Rep did not use any spiel neither for for opening nor closing.

Personalization was missing through out the call - Consultant should have asked for his name if the information was not availble to address him better.

Choice of words : Rep instread of looking for a reason why the customer did not enroll for the service, Should have check if he faced any challenge during the enrollment, and should have offer assistance if required

Rebuttal was timed incorrectly 
and it was given without sharing the price(premium change hone wala hai) - Rep should have given the price first.


Rep should have studied the account before he made the call when customer was looking for the price he was trying to fetch customer details - Rep was not prepared. 

Rep did not make use of the available information. I believe he had all relevant information however he did not capitalise on that information as rep said he already selected the desired plan however did not proceed further.

Rep did not show customer service skill and provide general information- he should have googled (CC for Sx4) and should have given precise information.

Choice of words: " Sir Kitne CC ka engine hai."  rep should have used this instead.  

When customer requested to call his friend rep denied -Service "No"- if he is not allowed, it should be backed by a solid reason. Rep left an impression that he is not willing to help  the customer.

Rep instead of saying (sir app callback nahi kar paiyege) Should have rephrased it the other way round and should have offered a callback and should have follwed up with the customer.

Overall good show however need to work upon the choice of words. and soft skills (use of pleasantries)  
Positives

Rate of speech was good.
